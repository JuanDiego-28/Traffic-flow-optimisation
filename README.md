# Traffic-flow-optimisation


# Description 

This repository contains the source code for a project aimed at optimizing traffic flow in the city of Quito, Ecuador, utilizing real-time data provided by the city's Mobility Department. The project leverages data analytics, machine learning, and traffic simulation techniques to develop intelligent solutions for reducing congestion and improving overall traffic efficiency.

# Features:

  Real-time data integration: The project incorporates real-time traffic data from sensors, cameras, and other sources provided by the Quito Mobility Department.
  Traffic flow analysis: Algorithms are used to analyze traffic patterns, identify bottlenecks, and predict congestion hotspots.
  Traffic simulation: A traffic simulation model is used to test and evaluate different optimization strategies before implementation.

# Technologies Used:

  Python: The primary programming language for data analysis, model development, and system implementation.
  OSMnx: A library for retrieving and working with OpenStreetMap data, used for creating street networks and analyzing city infrastructure.
  GeoPandas: A library for working with geospatial data, used for analyzing traffic patterns and visualizing results on maps.
  NetworkX: A library for creating, manipulating, and analyzing graphs, used for representing and analyzing the city's road network.
  Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for handling and processing real-time traffic data.
  NumPy: A fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, used for array operations and mathematical calculations.
  Matplotlib: A plotting library used for visualizing traffic data, network structures, and simulation results.
